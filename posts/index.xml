      <description>Recent advancements in long-context language models emphasize the importance of positional encoding, allowing the Transformer architecture to grasp long-range dependencies. The seminal paper &amp;ldquo;Attention is All You Need&amp;rdquo; introduced positional encoding as an external piece of information since the original Transformer architecture is permutation invariant. Furthermore, to encode distance relatively, the Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) was proposed. We will see that RoPE fits more intuitively within the framework of linear recurrence as a result of internal assumptions instead of external inductive-bias.</description>

      <description>This page contains links to notes from the USTC learning theory seminar, conducted by USTC graduate and undergraduate students. The primary resource for the seminar is Mathematical Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms. The &amp;ldquo;High-dimensional Probability an Introduction with Applications in Data Science&amp;rdquo; book is also recommended.
