<p>Modeling dynamic system is the core topic in control theory. Analytical methods involve solving differential equations and require symbolic computation.
In computer control, we seek to find computational models to solve the dynamic system. In SISO case, suppose that <code>$x(t) \in \mathbb R^d$</code> is the state of the system at time <code>$t$</code>, <code>$u(t) \in \mathbb R$</code> is the impulse and the response is <code>$y(t) \in \mathbb R$</code>. The system is described by the following equations.</p>
<p><code>$$ \begin{align} \frac{dx(t)}{dt} = F(x(t), u(t))\\ y(t) = H(x(t), u(t)) \end{align} $$</code></p>
<p>The state space is a <code>$d$</code>-dimensional space spanned by the state variables. And the evolution of state <code>$x$</code> can be drawn as a trajectory in the state space. For example, in control, the state is usually composed of the position, velocity and acceleration of the system i.e. <code>$x=\begin{bmatrix}r,\dot r, \ddot r\end{bmatrix}$</code>, depending on the sensor information. We call the system a linear time-invariant (LTI) system if the function <code>$F$</code> and <code>$H$</code> are independent of time <code>$t$</code> and linear with respect to <code>$x(t)$</code> and <code>$u(t)$</code>. The LTI system can be described by the following equations.</p>
<p><code>$$ \begin{align} \frac{dx(t)}{dt} &amp;= A x(t) + B u(t)\\ y(t) &amp;= C x(t) + D u(t) \end{align} $$</code></p>
<p>The system is parameterized by <code>$A\in\mathbb R^{d\times d}, B\in\mathbb R^{d}, C\in\mathbb R^{1\times d}$</code> and <code>$D\in\mathbb R$</code> is the direct feedthrough term, which can be seen as an analogy to skip connection in deep neural networks. The solution to the continuous time LTI system is given by the equations below.
The expressive power of the LTI system has been studied in control theory and signal processing for decades. In the context of deep learning, it is a linear recurrent neural network (RNN) and the expressive power and optimization property has been revisited.</p>
<p><code>$$ \begin{align} x(t) &amp;= e^{At}x(0) + \int_0^t e^{A(t-\tau)}B u(\tau) d\tau\\ y(t) &amp;= C e^{At}x(0) + \int_0^t C e^{A(t-\tau)}B u(\tau) d\tau + D u(t) \end{align} $$</code></p>
<p>Omitted the skip connection term, the solution to <code>$y$</code> can be computed as a convolution in zero impulse condition. We can see that matrix <code>$A$</code>, also called the system matrix, heavily modulates the convolution kernel, and plays an important role in modeling the system.</p>
<p><code>$$ \begin{aligned} \mathcal K(\mu) &amp;= C e^{A\mu}B\\ y(t) &amp;= (\mathcal K \star u)(t) \end{aligned} $$</code></p>
