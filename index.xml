      <description>Introduction In long context sequence modeling, Language models tend to forget in the middle. This is not a messy phenomenon related to the datasets but a systematic problem of the attention mechanism. It has been observed and leveraged in the acceleration of Transformer inference, as compressing the middle part of the sequence does not affect the performance much. But this is not a good thing to celebrate, as the model should be able to retrieve the middle part of the sequence according to the context, while they receive barely no attention from the model merely because of their position.</description>

      <description>Have no time for this, flesh out in the future
Modeling dynamic system is the core topic in control theory. Analytical methods involve solving differential equations and require symbolic computation. In computer control, we seek to find computational models to solve the dynamic system. In SISO case, suppose that $x(t) \in \mathbb R^d$ is the state of the system at time $t$, $u(t) \in \mathbb R$ is the impulse and the response is $y(t) \in \mathbb R$.</description>
